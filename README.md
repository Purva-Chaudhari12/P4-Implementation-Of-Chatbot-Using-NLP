# P4-Implementation-Of-Chatbot-Using-NLP
Chatbot Using NLP
Overview
This project showcases the implementation of a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Designed to deliver intelligent and contextually aware conversations, the chatbot leverages advanced NLP tools to understand user intents and provide meaningful responses. Built with NLTK, scikit-learn, and Streamlit, it features a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

Features
Intent Recognition: Accurately identifies user intents like greetings, farewells, and gratitude.
Dynamic Responses: Provides appropriate and engaging replies based on user queries.
Conversation Logs: Maintains a detailed history of user interactions for future reference.
Customizable Intents: Easily extendable to include new intents and responses.
Web-based Interface: Accessible and interactive interface powered by Streamlit.
Technologies Used
Python: Core language for development.
NLTK: For text processing and intent recognition.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning and classification.
Streamlit: For creating an intuitive web application.
JSON: To define intents and responses.
Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>  
cd <repository-directory>  
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`  
3. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt  
4. Download Required NLTK Data
python
Copy code
import nltk  
nltk.download('punkt')  
Usage
Run the chatbot application with the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py  
Once launched, interact with the chatbot via the web interface. Enter your query in the input box and press Enter to receive a response.

Intents and Behavior
The chatbotâ€™s responses are defined in the intents.json file, which includes:

Tags: Categories for user intents.
Patterns: Example phrases triggering specific intents.
Responses: Predefined replies linked to each tag.
To extend functionality, modify intents.json to add or edit intents, patterns, or responses.

Conversation History
The chatbot automatically records all conversations in a CSV file named chat_log.csv. Users can view these logs directly within the application by selecting the Conversation History option in the sidebar.
