**Chatbot Implementation Using Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

This project implements a chatbot powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to enable efficient and intelligent human-computer interaction. It is designed to handle user queries in real-time, providing relevant and context-aware responses.

**Problem Statement**

Traditional customer support systems often fail to deliver instant, accurate, and consistent responses, leading to user frustration and operational inefficiencies. Manual handling of repetitive queries consumes valuable resources and time. This project addresses the need for an automated conversational agent that improves interaction quality and reduces the workload on human operators.

**Objectives**

Develop a chatbot capable of understanding natural language inputs and generating human-like responses.
Implement advanced NLP techniques, including intent recognition and entity extraction, to ensure context-aware interactions.
Evaluate the chatbotâ€™s performance based on accuracy, scalability, and response relevance.

**Features**

Natural Language Understanding: Processes user queries with NLP techniques like tokenization, stemming, and intent recognition.
Contextual Responses: Uses Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT or GPT) for improved context awareness and response generation.
Fallback Mechanism: Handles unrecognized queries gracefully with a fallback system.

**Scalability**: Adaptable for various domains such as customer support, education, and healthcare.

**Methodology**

Preprocess textual data using tokenization, lemmatization, and other NLP techniques.
Utilize pre-trained language models for intent recognition and response generation.
Test and evaluate the chatbot on domain-specific datasets to ensure accuracy and robustness.

**Results**

The chatbot achieved an intent recognition accuracy of 92% and demonstrated high performance in handling diverse conversational scenarios.

**Future Enhancements**

Multilingual Support: Extend capabilities to process multiple languages.
Voice Integration: Enable voice-based interaction for greater accessibility.
Sentiment Analysis: Incorporate sentiment detection to refine responses based on user emotions.


**How to Run the Project**

**Installation**
1. Clone the Repository
   
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
   
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install Required Packages
   
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Download NLTK Data

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')

**Usage**
To run the chatbot application, execute the following command:

streamlit run app.py
Once the application is running, you can interact with the chatbot through the web interface. Type your message in the input box and press Enter to see the chatbot's response.
